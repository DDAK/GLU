# This file contains a series of scripts for retieving the SG sequence of a day (i.e. combining the daytime and nighttime sequences) in different ways.

# Join the day and night of vd including the interpolated end points.
# This is used to derive statistics based on the area under the curve e.g. AUC, proportion of time, etc.
# Returns a data frame containing the data for the whole day (daytime and nighttime) of vd.
